# Google Apps Script Setup Guide for Lead Capture Form

## Step 1: Create Google Apps Script

1. Go to [script.google.com](https://script.google.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Delete the default code and paste the entire content from `google_apps_script.js`
4. Save the project with a name like "Lead Capture Form Handler"

## Step 2: Set Up Google Sheet

### Option A: Use Existing Sheet
1. Open your Google Sheet
2. Copy the Spreadsheet ID from the URL (the long string between `/d/` and `/edit`)
3. In the Apps Script, replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE` with your actual ID

### Option B: Create New Sheet (Recommended for Testing)
1. In the Apps Script editor, run the `createTestSpreadsheet()` function
2. Check the logs to get the new Spreadsheet ID
3. Copy that ID and replace `YOUR_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE` in the script

## Step 3: Deploy the Script

1. Click "Deploy" â†’ "New deployment"
2. Choose "Web app" as the type
3. Set "Execute as" to "Me"
4. Set "Who has access" to "Anyone"
5. Click "Deploy"
6. **Copy the Web App URL** - this is your new script URL

## Step 4: Update Your Form

1. Open `lead_capture_form.html`
2. Replace the `SCRIPT_URL` constant with your new deployment URL
3. Save the file

## Step 5: Test the Integration

1. Open your updated form in a browser
2. Fill out and submit the form
3. Check your Google Sheet for new entries
4. Check the Apps Script logs for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### If you get permission errors:
- Make sure the script is deployed as a web app
- Check that "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"
- Verify the Spreadsheet ID is correct

### If data isn't appearing in the sheet:
- Check the Apps Script logs for errors
- Verify the sheet name matches (default is "Leads")
- Make sure you have edit permissions on the spreadsheet

### To check logs:
- In the Apps Script editor, click "Executions" in the left sidebar
- Look for recent executions and check the logs

## Data Structure

The script will create a sheet with these columns:
- Timestamp
- Full Name
- Email
- Phone
- IP Address
- City
- Country
- Browser
- Lead ID

Each submission gets a unique Lead ID for tracking.
